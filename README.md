### 2. Jar App Exploration
In this section, feedback from Jar app users was examined, specifically focusing on issues related to withdrawal functionality. Insights were gathered from reviews on Google Play and user feedback, identifying areas of improvement to enhance user experience.

#### Key Findings:

### 3. Product Optimization: Jar App's "Spin to Win" Feature

The "Spin to Win" feature offers users 5 spins for every transaction they make. However, based on analysis, there are several potential optimizations to improve user engagement and retention:

#### A. Increase Potential Prize Money:
- **Current State**: Users generally receive ₹2 or cashback coupons on each spin.
- **Recommendation**: Consider offering a higher initial reward (e.g., ₹5) to build a habit, then normalize rewards afterward. This strategy mirrors approaches used by platforms like Google Pay.

#### B. Lower Cumulative Reward Threshold:
- **Current Threshold**: Users must accumulate ₹100 to redeem their rewards for digital gold.
- **Recommendation**: Lowering the threshold will encourage more users to engage and remain active on the platform.

#### C. Balance Investment and Reward:
- It's important to ensure users feel fairly compensated for their time and effort spent engaging with the feature, maintaining motivation over time.

#### D. Introduce Gamification Elements:
- Add elements such as **levels, challenges, badges, leaderboards, and progress tracking** to make the "Spin to Win" feature more engaging and interactive, fostering long-term user retention.

#### E. Social Sharing for Virality:
- **Social Sharing**: Enable users to share their winnings and achievements on social media. This will promote virality and drive user acquisition through word-of-mouth.

### Conclusion:
This report outlines the analysis of Walmart sales data, user experience issues with the Jar app, and potential optimizations for the "Spin to Win" feature. By addressing these areas, both Walmart and Jar can improve user engagement, satisfaction, and retention.
